## Overview

Reasoning models often require high post-training budgets and extremely long reasoning chains(think 32k/64k) for maximising performance. Can we improve these models even if both these parameters are capped?

To this end, we first introduce: **Ramanujan-Ganit-R1-14B**, a 14-billion-parameter reasoning language model derived from Deepseek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-14B, trained at an affordable cost of only $499, and achieving SOTA mathematical reasoning performance within a 16K context window. On the latest olympiad level exams: AIME-25 and HMMT-25, our model not only **surpasses o3-mini-low, o1-mini and LightR1-14B (16k)** at pass@1 scores (averaged over 64 runs) but also delivers **performance rivaling closed-source o4-mini (low)** w.r.t cons@64 — all while staying within a **16K context window**. It achieves 52.71% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME2025 and 35.26% Pass@1 accuracy on HMMT25 (+7.2% and +5.2% improvement over the base model respectively). When provided with additional test-time compute in the form of cons@64, it achieves an impressive 76.7% accuracy on AIME2025 and 56.7% accuracy on HMMT25 (+13.4% and +6.7% improvement over the base model respectively). We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on carefully curated datasets using a specific training approach, followed by model merging, achieving this performance at a total training cost of just $499!

We also introduce **Ramanujan-Ganit-R1-14B-RS**, another model achieving performance comparable to our first, at a total training cost of just $967. It leverages post-training techniques—including reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning—in a multi-stage, cost-effective manner, followed by model merging.

We are **open-sourcing our models, training recipes and datasets** which we believe will help the community to progress further in the reasoning domain.

## 📊 Evaluation
We evaluate Ramanujan-Ganit‑R1-14B using the same metrics and sampling configuration introduced in the DeepSeek‑R1 paper, namely **pass@1** and **cons@64**. However, our evaluation is conducted under a reduced output budget of 16,384 tokens, compared to DeepSeek‑R1’s 32,768 tokens, to better reflect practical deployment constraints.

- **pass@1**: Pass@1 is computed as the average correctness over k sampled solution chains per problem (in our experiments we keep k=64).
- **cons@64**: Assesses consistency by sampling 64 reasoning chains per question and computing the majority vote accuracy.

**Evaluation Configuration**:

- Temperature: 0.6  
- top_p: 0.95  
- Number of sampled chains: 64  
- Context: 16,384 tokens  

This setup allows us to benchmark Ramanujan-Ganit-R1-14B’s reasoning performance and stability under realistic memory and inference budgets, while maintaining compatibility with the DeepSeek‑R1 evaluation protocol.

We utilize the evaluation framework provided by the [LIMO](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO) repository to run inference and compute metrics.
For detailed instructions and implementation details, please refer to [`eval/README.md`](./eval/readme.md).

## Results
We evaluate and compare **Ramanujan-Ganit‑R1-14B** with several baseline models across 3 challenging benchmarks:  **AIME25**, **HMMT25**, and **GPQA**. For each, we report `pass@1` and `cons@64`, following the same evaluation configuration.

| **Ramanujan-Ganit‑R1-14B (Ours)**          | **52.71**      | **76.67**     | **35.26**      | **56.67**     |



**Ramanujan-Ganit‑R1-14B** demonstrates highly competitive performance across all datasets, improving over the original R1-distilled models while closely matching or surpassing other strong baselines in several settings. 
On both AIME 25 and HMMT 25, our model shows the highest pass@1 as well as cons@64 scores among all the open-source models (including the bigger R1-Distilled-32B model), with R1-670B being the only exception.

In fact, we observe that Ramanujan-Ganit-R1-14B is superior to the first two generations of OpenAI's mini-reasoning models, including **o1-mini** and **o3-mini (low)** and it's performance closely matches that of newly released **o4-mini (low)** if provided with additional test-time compute.

## 🌍 Generalization Beyond Math: GPQA-Diamond

Notably, we also observe out-of-domain improvement in **GPQA-Diamond**, even though there wasn't a single instance of non-math questions in our training data. 
This indicates that our training methodology mentioned above and training on math questions facilitates generalization across diverse domains, a finding similar to what LightR1-14B & LIMO had observed.
#### ✅ GPQA Benchmark Comparison (16k)
| **Model**         | **pass@1** | **cons@64** |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B          | 54.19      | 64.14       |
| LightR1‑14B                           | 56.94      | 65.15       |
| Ramanujan-Ganit‑R1-14B-RS             | 59.13      | 66.16       |
| **Ramanujan-Ganit‑R1-14B**            | **59.46**  | **66.16**   |

## Data Decontimination

Both benchmarks used (AIME 25 and HMMT 25) were released a few weeks after the release of the base model, ensuring no contamination occurred during the model's pre-training. The dataset corpora (Numina-Math 1.5 & OpenR1-Math) were released around the same time as these exams, with a cutoff date no later than 2024. Additionally, we conduct checks to verify there is no contamination in the training data.
